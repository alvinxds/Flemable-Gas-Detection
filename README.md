The use of thermal cameras operating in the infrared spectrum is becoming more and more popular over time in the development of gas imaging techniques, as it is a fast, easy and secure way of remotely obtaining data for this purpose. The information extracted from the infrared play has a major role in a variety of applications, such as early detection of leaks at oil refineries or high voltage transmission at substations, thus protecting the environment subsequently avoiding adverse effects. The most recent generation of gas thermal cameras utilize a highly sensitive system based on detecting the differences between two infrared thermal images by applying simultaneously two distinct absorption filters in order to visualize the gas more clearly. Despite the innovation of this high cost technology, due to the complicated composition of filters, the result is insufficient because the produced images are full of noise resulting in low quality. Subsequently, an advanced system is needed to detect precisely the fuse of gases from the raw thermal images. The objective of this thesis is to design such an automatic gas detection and visualization system by suggesting two individual approaches. The first proposes a machine learning and computer vision technique, where moving objects in video frames are detected and classified as gases or non-gases, based on texture and spatiotemporal characteristics. As regards the second approach, which is based on digital imaging techniques, the background of the scene is extracted with background subtraction methods, combining synchronized video frames from visible and infrared spectrum, detecting gas at pixel level. Moreover, this thesis presents a wide analysis of the proposed methodologies, compares the categorization performance of spatiotemporal descriptors from two different classifiers and evaluates the gas detection efficiency of the background subtraction system. The evaluated methods of this thesis provide satisfactory gas detecting results followed by the corresponding individual false detections.
